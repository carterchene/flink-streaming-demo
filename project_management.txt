notes on flink project: 

Setting up the kafka server: 
Boot up ec2. Docker-compose up kafka shit, should be using local host since the eventsim is in the docker network 
Boot up event sim with startup script from root
View on port externalIP:9021 in my local browser

I've got flink working. Need to create a script for consuming it from the kafka eventsim topics. Need to figure out the schema. Will use both the table and datastream api. Start with table api. 

Look to spark logic to see if i can grok the schema


NOTES JULY 28:
Okay my word_count.py consumes the kafka topics from eventsim on the server. 
We can basically do all our development locally now, figure out the data modelling, and then deploy to a cluster later.
